### Project Description
The system created will be an inventory and sales tool. The tool will have users which allow us to login and track individual sales. The tool will also allow for us to track inventory. It will allow us to input what inventory we have through commands built into the tool. We will be able to input a command to check and see general inventory as well as what is currently low on inventory. We want to be able to look at the inventory by the department type. The tool will also go through and give suggestions on what to order based on what is selling well, and current stock levels. The tool will be able to give daily and weekly reports of what is sold, overall sales, as well as individual users sale totals. If the system is shut down, the tool should have saved the information and be able to load if after turning the system on again. The tool will also allow for general editing of price of inventory so that changes may be made over time.
